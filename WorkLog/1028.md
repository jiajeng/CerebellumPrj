## affine matrix to suit space
in T1 file, run suit normalize will create a mc_NAME.nii and mc_NAME.mat  
mc_NAME.mat contains Affine, VG(Vtemplate) and VF(VSource)  
affine matrix = VG.mat*inv(Affine)/VF.mat;  

## affine matrix in spm
in spm normalize will not to get a .mat file  
BUT in coregister will get a .mat file  
this .mat file will contains affine matrix

change spm_coreg.m line 340 to save affine matrix display in Graphics --> save to [SourceName.mat]
BUT when check origin .nii file multiple coregister .nii file is NOT RIGHT for coordinate
